# Quick Start

This section will help you quickly get started with UTags, including installation, basic setup, and first-use guide.

## Installation Guide

### Choosing Between Browser Extension and User Script

Choose the installation method that suits your usage habits and needs.

### User Script Installation

User script is a lightweight browser extension method, suitable for those who want to keep their browser lightweight or don't want to install a complete extension. UTags provides a fully functional user script version, which you can install through the following steps:

#### Prerequisites

1. **Install a User Script Manager**: You need to first install one of the following user script managers:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Recommended, supports all mainstream browsers)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (Open source option, suitable for Firefox/Chrome)
   - [ScriptCat](https://scriptcat.org/) (Chinese script manager with Chinese interface)
     ![User Script Manager Installation](../assets/install-userscript-1.png)

#### Installation Steps

#### User Script Permission Settings

If you find that the user script is not working on webpages after installation, please check the following settings:

1. **Enable Browser Developer Mode** (required for some browsers):

   - **Chrome**: Visit `chrome://extensions/`, check "Developer mode" in the upper right corner
   - **Edge**: Visit `edge://extensions/`, turn on "Developer mode"
   - **Firefox**: Visit `about:addons`, click Extensions, then click the settings icon, select "Debug Add-ons"

2. **Check Script Manager Permissions**:
   - In the script manager's settings page, ensure that "Allow User Scripts" is enabled
   - Confirm that the script manager's website access permissions are set correctly (usually requires "All websites" permission)
   - Check if the UTags script is disabled or in a paused state

#### Troubleshooting

- **Script Not Working**: Try restarting the script manager, restarting the browser, or checking if there are any error messages in the script manager's console
- **Permission Issues**: Some websites may restrict user script execution; try setting permissions for that website separately in the script manager
